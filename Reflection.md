# Project Overview

This project is based on the entertainment  survey form using HTML,CSS, and JavaScript.This allows users to share the entertainment preferences of their own such as favorite movies,music, and streaming platforms.This survey collects the personal information like mails and the proper name of theirs and the error messages also will appear if the information is in wrong format.

- What I learned

I leant the structure of HTML  about the fields and legend.
Practiced about the styling of borders and responsive layouts in the professional ways.
learnt about the radio buttons in this assignments.

Challenges I Faced
The only challenge I faced during this project was the proper layout for the survey and the color combination for the layout so that everyone can easily fill out survey.

- Improvements I will make in the future.
In the future i will try to add some animations layouts in the background so that my survey form will stand out more different from others in professional  way and also to do better in  the accessibility of the survey.
